Avoid gendered pronouns like he and she unless you are sure how someone identifies. Ask for someone’s pronouns or neo-pronouns before using a specific gender — otherwise, use the non-binary. 

Stop using phrases like the opposite sex, it suggests there is only the binary. The phrase “biological” men or women is hurtful because it suggests there are gender experiences that are more normal than others. Born a woman is the same thing. And don’t use someone’s dead name with phrases like [he/she/they] went by. Gender is a personal and societal construct, not one which is absolute based on whether someone was born male or born a girl.

Marketers use the phrase target audience quite a bit, and may not realize it has violent undertones. Same with real estate terms like master bedroom which connotes slavery.

Consider revising phrases that specify gender, unless the individual’s gender identity is known. It's respectful to inquire about a person's preferred pronouns or to use gender-neutral language if uncertain. This approach avoids assumptions and embraces a wider understanding of gender as a spectrum, rather than limiting it to traditional binary notions.

The concept of referring to individuals by a binary gender classification can unintentionally exclude those who identify outside of these categories. Terms that imply gender binary, such as 'biological' male or female, can be seen as diminishing the varied experiences of gender. It's more considerate to acknowledge gender as a complex and personal aspect of identity that isn't solely determined by physical characteristics at birth.

Language commonly used in various industries can sometimes carry unintended connotations. For instance, marketing language often includes terms that, while common, might not be perceived as inclusive or sensitive by all audiences. Analyzing the implications of these terms can lead to more thoughtful and inclusive communication strategies.

Real estate terminology, such as 'master bedroom,' has been critiqued for its historical associations. As language evolves, the industry is moving towards more neutral and inclusive descriptions that do not inadvertently reference or evoke historical injustices.

When referring to someone's previous identity or name, it's essential to consider their preferences and the significance of acknowledging their true self. Using a name or identity that someone has chosen to move away from can be deeply hurtful. Respecting individuals' journeys and identities is a key aspect of inclusive and respectful communication.
